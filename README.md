## Project: "Brand Name" or Device Name

### Conceptual Description

/// Replace with a description of the ***critical / conceptual dimensions of your project***, with specific reference to the key issues it engages.  These should intersect with the issues that have been explored in the readings and discussions during the first half of class:  eWaste, data security/ownership in relation to corporate cloud infrastructures; critical making; surveillance and privacy, etc. ** *How does your project engage with these issues beyond mere instrumentality?* ** ///
This project explores the concept of e-waste. People normally don't think much of their electronic waste because nowadays it seems like a normal part of life and is a small motion to toss in a trashcan. However, the there is short and long term amplification.

### Form

/// Your project should be embodied in a ***physical form*** that reflects, embodies, and/or amplifies those your project's main concepts and ideas.
Explain your design choices here and include images that document your project's material embodiment. ///
